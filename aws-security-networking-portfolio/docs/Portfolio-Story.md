# Portfolio Story (copy/paste for GitHub / LinkedIn)

I built an AWS Security + Networking portfolio focused on production patterns used in enterprise cloud environments.

**Highlights**
- Designed a hub/spoke network core with an inspection VPC, centralized egress, and AWS Network Firewall policies.
- Implemented identity guardrails using SCPs + permission boundaries, including a break-glass workflow and least-privilege access patterns.
- Built a centralized logging and detection pipeline using CloudTrail, GuardDuty, Security Hub, and OpenSearch Dashboards for security investigation.
- Hardened a serverless API with WAF rules, Cognito authentication, KMS encryption, private service access via VPC endpoints, and CloudWatch alarms.

**Skills demonstrated**
AWS: VPC, Transit Gateway, Network Firewall, IAM, Organizations/SCPs (conceptual), CloudTrail, GuardDuty, Security Hub, OpenSearch, CloudWatch, KMS, WAF, API Gateway, Lambda, Cognito, VPC Endpoints.

**Delivery**
Each project includes architecture, Terraform IaC, validation steps, runbooks, and threat modeling artifacts.
